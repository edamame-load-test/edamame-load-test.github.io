Abstract">‚Äã</a></h2><p>Edamame is a distributed load testing framework for real-time collaboration apps that use both HTTP and WebSockets. Edamame is built for medium-sized companies and can support up to 200k concurrently connected users. Edamame collects client-side metrics and displays data in near real-time, which provides developers with deep insight into their systems. The ability to dynamically start and stop tests makes Edamame safe to run in either a staging or production environment.</p><p>Creating a load tester with these features comes with a unique set of challenges. First, the load tester needs to test the target system with multiple protocols in tandem and ensure that the concerns of different protocols are thoroughly addressed. Second, medium-sized companies need to simulate a high volume of traffic, which requires a distributed architecture and adds significant complexity to the tool. Third, providing client-side metrics in near real-time means systems need to be in place to collect, process, store, and visualize data in a performant manner.</p><p>Edamame provides an open-source, easy-to-use, plug-and-play solution to the above challenges.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="2-background-load-testing">2.

In a load test, a number of programmatically generated &quot;virtual users&quot; are automated to interact with the system in pre-defined patterns. This process helps developers identify performance bottlenecks within a system and ensures that user experience won&#x27;t be negatively impacted, even under heavy strain.</p><div class="text--center"><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/2-1-Distributed-Load-Test-853b04177bce6ea1a253fd3a4fa18eb4.png" alt="Example banner" width="800" class="img_ev3q"><p> üñºÔ∏èDepiction of a simple load test</p></div><p>One way to perform a basic load test is to use an HTTP benchmarking tool, like <code>wg/wrk</code><sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2" class="footnote-ref">2</a></sup>.

Client-side metrics<a href="#i-client-side-metrics" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to i. Client-side metrics" title="Direct link to i. Client-side metrics">‚Äã</a></h4><p>The first thing we need to consider when building a load-testing tool is what metrics are collected.</p><p>Some load tests are focused on server-side metrics, which include measurements like CPU usage and memory consumption for the target system. This informs developers about the health of their servers. These measurements are often obtained by system monitoring tools outside the load tester&#x27;s purview.</p><p>Other load tests are focused on understanding how the user experience changes under heavy load. In these cases, developers track client-side metrics. These provide important insight by measuring things like HTTP response time, which tells us the overall latency of the target system. Other important measurements include the number of failed HTTP requests. An increase in numbers for either of these could indicate that the system is starting to regress.</p><p>Next, it&#x27;s important to determine how these measurements are analyzed. One option is to generate an aggregated summary. This makes results easy to parse and provides a high-level overview of how the system responded.  </p><div class="language-txt codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockTitle_Ktv7">wrk summary</div><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-txt codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">Running 30s test @ http://127.0.0.1:8080/index.html</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">  12 threads and 400 connections</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">  Thread Stats   Avg      Stdev     Max   +/- Stdev</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">    Latency   635.91us    0.89ms  12.92ms   93.69%</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">    Req/Sec    56.20k     8.07k   62.00k    86.54%</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">  22464657 requests in 30.00s, 17.76GB read</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">Requests/sec: 748868.53</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">Transfer/sec:    606.33MB</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg class="copyButtonIcon_y97N" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div><p>One drawback of this approach is that it lacks granularity. An alternative is to plot individual data points along a time axis. This way, data is detailed enough to understand exactly when problems start to arise and we can also analyze causal relationships between different data points.</p><p>That being said, this approach has challenges of its own. Data generated from load testing tends to be &quot;noisy&quot;, that is, it lacks consistency and reliability making it difficult to discern trends. To do so, we can perform data smoothing, which would involve taking some kind of average at time intervals. However, when performing load tests data points tend to differ by orders of magnitude, for example, we might see a response time of 100ms as well as 10s. Because of this disparity, taking an average skews results.</p><p>Instead, it&#x27;s more effective to look at percentiles. For example, if the 50th percentile, also known as the median, is 500ms then you know that 50% of response times were less than 500ms, and 50% were more. Looking at the tail end (&gt;90%) of percentiles allows developers to understand the experience the majority of users have. If the 90th percentile of response times is 1,800ms, it means that 90% of users have response times equal to or less than 1,800ms. In the context of load testing, therefore, looking at higher percentiles (90th, 95th, 99th) tends to be more telling than the median.</p><div class="text--center"><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/2-b-i-percentiles-d21777a9941f7ce228dc5da994289b20.png" alt="Example banner" width="800" class="img_ev3q"><p> üñºÔ∏èVisualizing 99% percentiles</p></div><p>It&#x27;s also important to consider that summaries are only output at the end of a test. For a short test waiting for these results may not be an issue. However, load tests can be very long, sometimes they take days. In this case, developers have to wait until the end of the test to view the results. Instead of waiting through the duration of the test, load testers can output granular data in near real-time.</p><p>Near real-time data output can be useful because it allows developers to respond to developments in test results as they occur. For example, developers can stop a test once a certain threshold is reached. However, near real-time processing is an engineering challenge, and may not be worth the additional complexity involved based on developer needs.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="ii-scale">ii. Scale<a href="#ii-scale" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to ii. Scale" title="Direct link to ii. Scale">‚Äã</a></h4><p>Running load tests locally is limiting. It&#x27;s difficult to simulate thousands of separate users on a single host. Even a load testing tool with a fairly low memory footprint used on a 2-core CPU host with 8GB of RAM can generate a maximum of about 6k virtual users<sup id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3" class="footnote-ref">3</a></sup>.</p><p>There are three main limiting factors to local load testing:</p><ul><li><strong>CPU</strong>: The CPU is heavily utilized in a load test. If it is not powerful enough, it can become a bottleneck, slowing down the test and limiting the number of virtual users that can be simulated.</li><li><strong>Memory</strong>: Load tests running on a single host cannot generate more virtual users than the RAM will support. Load tests often use 1 - 20 MB per virtual user, so even with only 1000 VUs, you might need up to 20GB of RAM to run that load test.</li><li><strong>Network</strong>: If the network throughput is too low, the load test may not accurately simulate the real-world conditions of user traffic, resulting in inaccurate or unreliable test results. For instance, in our example host above the network bandwidth is up to 10GB<sup id="fnref-4"><a href="#fn-4" class="footnote-ref">4</a></sup>.</li></ul><p>If local resources do not allow a developer to reach the desired number of virtual users, then it&#x27;s necessary to run a distributed load test. In a <strong>distributed load test</strong>, multiple hosts generate load. The hosts which create virtual users and run the test are often known as &quot;load generator nodes&quot; or &quot;test runner nodes&quot;. These can be horizontally scaled to support the number of virtual users required.</p><div class="text--center"><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/2-b-ii-distributed-load-test-c316fbae91895c807247b93746c7f09b.png" alt="Example banner" width="800" class="img_ev3q"><p> üñºÔ∏èDepiction of a distributed load test</p></div><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="iii-testing-environment">iii. Testing environment<a href="#iii-testing-environment" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to iii. Testing environment" title="Direct link to iii. Testing environment">‚Äã</a></h4><p>Developers also need to consider which environment their load tests target. Often, staging environments are used to mirror production environments. This provides a level of isolation that enables load tests to be conducted without fear of taking down any critical production services.</p><p>That being said, developers may still want to run load tests in a production environment because this yields the most accurate results<sup id="fnref-5"><a href="#fn-5" class="footnote-ref">5</a></sup>. Moreover, some companies (such as fast-growth startups) may not have the time or financial resources to implement a fully duplicated staging environment. Finally, there might be overlapping resources between both staging and production. In this case, staging environments are not perfectly isolated, and developers need to be careful and prevent consequences for real end users.</p><div class="text--center"><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/2-b-iii-shared-environment-6e513cb9b1a75b9f4e8a98414e09a0a6.png" alt="Example banner" width="800" class="img_ev3q"><p> üñºÔ∏èDepiction of staging and production potentially having overlapping resources</p></div><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="c-summary">c.

WebSockets allow for bi-directional communication between the client and server, unlike HTTP, in which a client must first initiate communication with a server by issuing a request. This persistent connection allows the server to stream events back to a client in real time.</p><p>On the client side, a browser needs a WebSocket object to facilitate this persistent connection. The WebSocket object uses event-based asynchronous callbacks to handle incoming messages from the server, and can also send messages to the server. WebSocket messages, unlike HTTP, don&#x27;t require a response.</p><p>On the server side, to connect with clients, a separate WebSockets server must be added. This increases the complexity of the architecture. It has traffic existing in two places; the WS server and the HTTP server.</p><div class="text--center"><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/logo-light-green-63d3612d3b6478f963f4f702cf93876b.png" alt="Example banner" width="400" class="img_ev3q"><p> üñºÔ∏èDepiction of a more complex system including traffic split over two protocols</p></div><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="b-considerations-when-developing-a-collaboration-app">b.

WebSocket performance<a href="#i-websocket-performance" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to i. WebSocket performance" title="Direct link to i. WebSocket performance">‚Äã</a></h4><p>WebSocket is a different protocol from HTTP. As a result, performance is measured and tracked differently. With HTTP, developers focus on the request-response cycle, which means that metrics like latency for HTTP responses are paramount. However, as WebSockets do not require a response, messages can follow the &quot;fire and forget&quot; pattern. In this case, we&#x27;re more concerned about the persistent connection, for example, how many connections have been dropped vs. how many connections are currently being maintained.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="ii-supporting-separate-protocols">ii. Supporting separate protocols<a href="#ii-supporting-separate-protocols" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to ii. Supporting separate protocols" title="Direct link to ii. Supporting separate protocols">‚Äã</a></h4><p>Supporting two different protocols introduces significant complexity to the system. For example, HTTP and WebSocket servers could have different scaling needs. To determine the scalability thresholds of each, load tests need to be run that address both traffic patterns.</p><p>WebSocket clients exhibit different behavior from those that are connected via HTTP. When an HTTP server fails, traffic can be load balanced and re-directed to another server the next time a request is issued. However, if a WebSocket server fails, all clients are disconnected from that bi-directional communication simultaneously. Often, they all try to reconnect at the same time, which can create a &quot;thundering herd&quot;<sup id="fnref-7"><a href="#fn-7" class="footnote-ref">7</a></sup> problem.

Fan-out messaging pattern<a href="#iii-fan-out-messaging-pattern" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to iii. Fan-out messaging pattern" title="Direct link to iii. Fan-out messaging pattern">‚Äã</a></h4><p>The fan-out messaging pattern utilizes a one-to-many arrangement to emit messages, which enables a collaboration app to distribute messages to all users connected to the same channel in real-time. A message could be a chat message, a user&#x27;s mouse movements, entering text into a shared document, drawing something on a whiteboard, or any other sort of data that needs to be propagated back up to collaborators.</p><p>For these types of apps, the message can be published through an HTTP request or WebSocket message from the client. To enable real-time communication, messages are sent back up to subscribed collaborators via WebSockets. Depending on how large the channel is, one published message can lead to a sizable fan-out.</p><p>For example, if you send a message to a Slack channel with 1k subscribers, the single POST request that sends the message turns into 1k WebSocket messages being emitted.</p><div class="text--center"><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/3-b-iii-fanout-5d3201d37ce9a049f89741f71f8ee357.gif" alt="Example banner" width="400" class="img_ev3q"><p> üñºÔ∏èFanout</p></div><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="c-summary-1">c.

WebSocket servers and clients behave differently than their HTTP counterparts, so additional scenarios like WebSocket performance, thundering herds, and fan-out messaging must be accounted for. To ensure this, developers perform load tests that accurately mimic these kinds of behaviors.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="4-load-testing-for-collaboration-apps">4.

For example, Miro grew from 12k to 100k concurrently connected users in less than one year<sup id="fnref-8"><a href="#fn-8" class="footnote-ref">8</a></sup>.

Generating HTTP and WebSocket traffic">‚Äã</a></h3><p>Typically, the HTTP server and WS server need to be tested in tandem to get an accurate picture of how the system responds to load. For applications that only support HTTP endpoints, an HTTP load tester is sufficient. However, collaboration apps cannot rely on HTTP requests alone for load testing, as client traffic is divided between two different protocols. HTTP-focused load tests do not cover all components of a collaborative application&#x27;s architecture.</p><div class="text--center"><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/4-a-ws-vs-http-e3b91a8a00d99edff84e97c984642eda.png" alt="Example banner" width="800" class="img_ev3q"><p> üñºÔ∏èAn image that shows how HTTP only tests part of the infrastructure </p></div><p>In an HTTP load test, requests are sent to the HTTP server. This causes data to be sent to the WebSocket server in response so that published messages can be propagated to subscribed users. However, if the virtual users in the load test do not maintain persistent WebSocket connections, the WebSocket server never has to emit any messages (there are no active subscribers). This means that a critical part of the architecture never has to sustain any load.</p><p>Due to fan-out messaging, the number of WebSocket messages that must be sent (and therefore, the amount of load the WebSocket server must sustain) can be orders of magnitude different from the number of HTTP requests being received. It is important that the virtual users in the load test accurately simulate the persistently connected WebSocket clients.</p><div class="text--center"><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/4-a-full-coverage-53f63eb3c918dd325facb840af5f9eda.png" alt="Example banner" width="800" class="img_ev3q"><p> üñºÔ∏èAn image that shows how a system can be tested holistically, with persistently connected clients</p></div><p>The load tester should also collect meaningful metrics pertaining to both HTTP and WebSockets.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="b-scaling-to-100k-concurrent-users">b.

Scaling to 100K+ concurrent users">‚Äã</a></h3><p>Collaboration apps have different needs for load tests, as the number of daily active users varies from company to company. For example, Miro grew from 12k to 100k concurrently connected users in less than a year. Another real-time collaboration app we contacted privately indicated they were running load tests of up to 100k concurrent users. For Slack, load tests ranged from 5k to 500k virtual users. Based on this, we believe that an effective load tester for a company in this space should be able to run load tests in the six-figure range (at least 100k virtual users).</p><p>Running load tests that generate this amount of virtual users necessitates a distributed architecture, due to the amount of compute resources required. In most cases, this means moving to the cloud. This requires several different cloud-based components, meaning the load tester needs a system to manage the required infrastructure.</p><p>One major concern with distributed load tests is how to synchronize the load generators. Load tests often have a predefined pattern for how the number of virtual users is ramped up and down over the duration of the test. Different patterns test how systems respond to different scenarios.</p><p>For example, a load test may ramp up from zero to 20k VUs over the course of a five-minute interval, and then immediately start ramping back down to zero VUs over the next five minutes. If this test is spread across two nodes, then both nodes must start the test at exactly the same time. Otherwise, the test will never reach 20k VUs at its peak.</p><div class="text--center"><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/4-b-peak-load-f70d6edf863ca57c3caf43742338c30f.png" alt="Example banner" width="800" class="img_ev3q"><p> üñºÔ∏èVisualizing why syncing nodes is important</p></div><p>Therefore, an effective load tester needs a way to synchronize load generator nodes to ensure they all start ramping up the load at the same time and stay in line with each other to match the predefined pattern of load.</p><p>Providing a way to manage load generator nodes also gives the load tester the ability to stop the test, in case critical aspects of a production environment are threatened by the additional load.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="c-collecting-and-displaying-data-in-near-real-time">c.

Collecting and displaying data in near real-time">‚Äã</a></h3><p>Fast-growth companies may not have time to set up isolated staging environments to perform tests (growth could happen overnight). A load testing tool can take the risks associated with this into consideration by providing near real-time results. This visibility allows developers to react quickly to system metrics, and the test can be stopped.</p><p>To facilitate near real-time visualization of data, the load tester requires a stream processing approach instead of batch processing. Batch processing presupposes the data has a defined start and finish, meaning that batch processing delivers results like end-of-test summaries. This is a time-consuming approach that does not suit the time-sensitive nature of load test data for tests targeting an agnostic environment.</p><div class="text--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://hazelcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/diagram-stream-processing.png" alt="Example banner" width="400" class="img_ev3q"><p> üñºÔ∏èGraphic showing simple stream processing system</p></div><p>Stream processing, on the other hand, assumes data is unbound and arrives continually over time. To derive analytics like percentiles from the data stream, the system splits data up into time intervals. All the data points that fit into one of these &quot;windows&quot; are aggregated and sent to storage. This comes with challenges of its own.</p><p>More virtual users mean more data. The amount of data depends on a variety of factors, including the type of load test, which load testing tool is used to conduct the test, which metrics are being collected, and how frequently they are being collected. For example, a test in which virtual users are making HTTP requests each second would result in a higher amount of data than a test in which a request is made every ten seconds. Stream processing data in vast quantities could be difficult.</p><p>Finally, a load tester needs a storage method and an effective visualization tool that can show all this data in an understandable way. The visualization tool can then continually pull from storage as data is added, allowing developers to see analyzed data as the test executes.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="5-existing-solutions">5. Existing solutions<a href="#5-existing-solutions" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 5. Existing solutions" title="Direct link to 5. Existing solutions">‚Äã</a></h2><p>There are many existing solutions for load testing tools like k6, Locust, JMeter, and Artillery. While all these companies offer open-source load testers, they are typically meant for local use, meaning resources for producing high numbers of virtual users are limited to one host. However, our specifications require supporting at least 100k users per test, which necessitates a distributed architecture.</p><p>It is possible to use an open-source tool in a distributed manner, but it involves managing all the necessary cloud infrastructure yourself. For example, JMeter offers a guide<sup id="fnref-9"><a href="#fn-9" class="footnote-ref">9</a></sup> and controller construct to help users run distributed tests. If a company has very specific needs, it may consider developing an internal load testing tool rather than extending the capabilities of an open-source tool by distributing the test.</p><p>This approach, however, involves significant complexity. Many open-source load testing tools offer managed cloud services that abstract away all the challenges of distribution. While this is a convenient option, it does come with limitations such as data ownership and cost.</p><p>Edamame aims to bridge the gap between open-source and paid cloud services by providing a load testing tool with built-in distribution management that&#x27;s simple to deploy and run.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="a-diy">a.

This makes it very easy for developers to run large-scale load tests.</p><p>That being said, cloud-based solutions also have their trade-offs. They can be very costly.

We made several considerations when selecting one, including performance, usability, and level of WebSocket support.</p><p>Performance considerations include things like requests per second and memory usage. Requests per second (or RPS) measures how much traffic a load testing tool is generating. A higher RPS means a more performant load generator, as it represents CPU efficiency; a higher RPS means less CPU is utilized per request. Memory usage is also a concern when trying to determine how scalable a load testing tool is, as large numbers of virtual users can be very demanding on RAM. Because Edamame needs to support such a high number of virtual users, we need a tool that requires a minimal amount of RAM per VU.</p><p>Ease of use is also an important consideration. For example, how does the user define the tests themselves? Using a scriptable tool allows developers to write detailed and flexible scenarios that virtual users will perform. Depending on the tool, these can be defined via either a general-purpose programming language or a DSL. Non-scriptable tools do not provide this kind of customization and flexibility.</p><p>Finally, the level of support for WebSockets varies from tool to tool. Some tools feature native support for WebSockets, others require third-party plugins, and some do not enable virtual users that simulate WebSocket clients at all.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Tool</th><th>wrk</th><th>Gatling</th><th>Artillery</th><th>K6</th><th>JMeter</th><th>Locust</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Written in</td><td>C</td><td>Scala</td><td>NodeJS</td><td>Go</td><td>Java</td><td>Python</td></tr><tr><td>Scriptable</td><td>Yes: Lua</td><td>Yes: Scala</td><td>Yes: JS</td><td>Yes: JS</td><td>Limited: XML</td><td>Yes: Python</td></tr><tr><td>Managed distributed load generation</td><td>No</td><td>No</td><td>Limited</td><td>No</td><td>No</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td>Max requests per second (RPS)</td><td>54100</td><td>4700</td><td>321</td><td>11300</td><td>7000</td><td>2900</td></tr><tr><td>Mem Usage per 1VU MB*</td><td>0.25</td><td>11.85</td><td>6.31</td><td>2.22</td><td>20.17</td><td>7.16</td></tr><tr><td>WS Support</td><td>No</td><td>Yes: Native</td><td>Yes: Native</td><td>Yes: Native</td><td>Yes: 3rd party</td><td>Yes: 3rd party</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Edamame&#x27;s load testing framework is an extended version of k6.

Containers allow us to duplicate applications along with their environment and dependencies for efficient deployment to multiple hosts. Deploying services with containers requires some kind of container orchestration tool. This enables us to deploy services, distribute the load, and tear down components as needed to facilitate the sometimes complex workflows of load testing.</p><p>Two of the major offerings for container orchestration in the AWS ecosystem are ECS (Elastic Container Services) and EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Services).

For example, multiple components in our architecture need access to the database; we can share credentials to enable this easily and securely by referencing a Kubernetes Secret in our Deployment configuration files for these components.</p><p>Kubernetes Services provide a permanent IP address to pods that persist across pod life cycles. This facilitates communication across nodes between different components of Edamame. Services are meant to act like sidecars to a pod so that they are not linked to the lifecycle of the pod. This makes our intra-network communication more resilient.</p><p>The main benefit of EKS is that it enables Edamame to manage the complex synchronization of load generator pods efficiently.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="ii-load-generator-synchronization">ii. Load generator synchronization<a href="#ii-load-generator-synchronization" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to ii. Load generator synchronization" title="Direct link to ii. Load generator synchronization">‚Äã</a></h4><p>The Kubernetes operator pattern allows Edamame to synchronize and manage distributed test runners over the duration of the load test. In Kubernetes, Operators are meant to extend the functionality of the API by providing domain-specific knowledge in the form of custom objects and processes.</p><p>By default, Kubernetes primitives are not meant to manage state<sup id="fnref-15"><a href="#fn-15" class="footnote-ref">15</a></sup>. Because load tests must be synchronized, there is an inherent element of state built into the deployment of the runner pods; the status of all the runners must be known before a single runner can begin execution. We can use an Operator to solve this problem of state management.</p><div class="text--center"><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/7-b-operator-07b27db9fd0cab81290cc1baf76419c5.png" alt="Example banner" width="800" class="img_ev3q"><p>üñºÔ∏èZoomed in on the depiction of the load generator node group + k6 operator.</p></div><p>K6 has provided us with such an Operator, it contains the domain-specific knowledge necessary to manage the complex workflows of running a distributed k6 load test. When the user provides a test script, Edamame translates that test script into a ConfigMap. Edamame then applies a custom resource that specifies both the test script and properties that determine how that test should be run (e.g. how many separate runners should be created).</p><p>Once it receives these properties, the Operator communicates with the Control Plane API to schedule three components:</p><ul><li>The initializer performs error handling for the test. It uses the Operator&#x27;s domain-specific knowledge to ensure that everything is configured in a way that&#x27;s best for a k6 load test (e.g. it checks the validity of the test script).</li><li>The starter is responsible for starting the execution of the test simultaneously in all runner pods.</li><li>The runner pods contain the custom k6 binary along with the test script and are responsible for generating the load and running the test.</li></ul><p>The Operator then continuously polls the runner pods for readiness, and when they are all ready, sends a signal to the starter pod to start the test.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="iii-managing-compute-resources">iii. Managing compute resources<a href="#iii-managing-compute-resources" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to iii. Managing compute resources" title="Direct link to iii. Managing compute resources">‚Äã</a></h4><p>Though the k6 operator takes care of generating the necessary number of pods, Edamame still needs to configure the compute resources used to run those pods. This helps us ensure the pods are running efficiently. To do so, the cluster has a designated node group for load generator pods that starts at zero and scales appropriately up and down each time a test is run. This keeps AWS charges to a minimum.</p><div class="text--center"><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/logo-light-green-63d3612d3b6478f963f4f702cf93876b.png" alt="Example banner" width="400" class="img_ev3q"><p>üñºÔ∏èCan have an animation here that shows node group scaling up and down, potentially with enough detail to show what affinity and anti-affinity rules are doing as well.</p></div><p>When Edamame runs a load test, properties such as Affinity/Anti-Affinity and Taints/Tolerations are used to ensure that each runner is scheduled on a single node within the designated node group. Affinity rules are Kubernetes configuration values that can be used to ensure pods running specific processes (i.e. our load generator pods) are being scheduled on the ideal node for those processes. Anti-Affinity rules prevent the same kind of pod from being placed on the same node. Taints and Tolerations ensure pods are <em>not</em> scheduled on the wrong kind of node (they allow a node to &quot;repel&quot; a certain kind of pod). Ensuring that a single node only hosts one runner pod allows us to maximize the computing resources of each node within the specialized node group.</p><p>The node group is specially configured to contain nodes that maximize the efficiency of the load generators. K6 benchmarks<sup id="fnref-16"><a href="#fn-16" class="footnote-ref">16</a></sup> indicate that up to 60k virtual users can be supported by a single <code>m5.24xlarge</code> node. That being said, how test scripts are written can radically affect how much memory a single virtual user requires. The official k6 recommendation<sup id="fnref-17"><a href="#fn-17" class="footnote-ref">17</a></sup> is to run no more than 30-40k virtual users per node. To be even safer, Edamame has a default value of 20k virtual users per node, but users can change this value to suit the needs of their specific tests.</p><p>To further maximize compute resources, changes are made to the kernel parameters for the specialized nodes. These include <code>sysctl</code> commands like extending the range of ports that can be used for outgoing connections, which increases the maximum requests per second. As making these adjustments requires low-level system access, Edamame deploys using EC2 instances with EKS rather than a serverless offering like Fargate.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="c-collecting-and-displaying-data-in-near-real-time-1">c.

Collecting and displaying data in near real-time" title="Direct link to c. Collecting and displaying data in near real-time">‚Äã</a></h3><p>While k6 was an ideal choice for a load testing tool in many ways for Edamame, it does have one significant trade-off: it generates a huge amount of data. For example, a test that simulates 100k virtual users where each VU sends a WebSocket ping every second and an HTTP request every six seconds results in outputting about 1 million data points per second.</p><table><thead><tr><th>VUs</th><th>data points output/sec</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1k</td><td>~ 10k</td></tr><tr><td>10k</td><td>~ 100k</td></tr><tr><td>100k</td><td>~ 1 M</td></tr></tbody></table><p>This magnitude of data output makes it impractical to write data directly to a database. For example, we tested writing directly to TimescaleDB (a performant time series database) and we found it handled only about 100k writes per second. To avoid highly complex components such as a sharded or distributed database<sup id="fnref-18"><a href="#fn-18" class="footnote-ref">18</a></sup>, Edamame implements a stream processing data pipeline.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="i-stream-processing-with-statsite-and-the-statsd-protocol">i. Stream processing with Statsite and the StatsD protocol<a href="#i-stream-processing-with-statsite-and-the-statsd-protocol" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to i. Stream processing with Statsite and the StatsD protocol" title="Direct link to i. Stream processing with Statsite and the StatsD protocol">‚Äã</a></h4><p>To mitigate the amount of data being output, Edamame outputs load test data from generator pods using the StatsD protocol. StatsD is a lightweight, fast, text-based protocol whose aim is to aggregate data efficiently in a single location. Unifying load test data in a single location on pre-determined time windows (known as &quot;flush intervals&quot;) enables more accurate percentile aggregation before sending data to the database for storage.</p><p>StatsD consists of three metric types:</p><ul><li><strong>Counters</strong> (<code>c</code>): represent values that are summed, such as the total amount of requests sent.</li><li><strong>Gauges</strong> (<code>g</code>): represent the &quot;latest&quot; value, such as the number of currently connected virtual users</li><li><strong>Timers</strong> (<code>ms</code>): track how long something takes. These values are aggregated into trends that can be broken out into percentiles, such as HTTP response time. Using StatsD enables us to specify which percentile we want to report (i.e. 50th, 95th, 99th).</li></ul><div class="language-txt codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockTitle_Ktv7">StatsD protocol</div><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-txt codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">k6.http_req_failed:1|c</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">k6.ws_current_connections:14.000000|g</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">k6.http_req_duration:132.231000|ms</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg class="copyButtonIcon_y97N" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div><p>The StatsD output data is sent to a StatsD server. The original StatsD server was developed by Etsy<sup id="fnref-19"><a href="#fn-19" class="footnote-ref">19</a></sup> and was written in NodeJS. It has several limitations, notably it only handles an ingestion rate of 10k/sec<sup id="fnref-20"><a href="#fn-20" class="footnote-ref">20</a></sup>.</p><p>Statsite is a more performant StatsD server written in C. It uses a single core with an event loop to handle much more data than the original StatsD server. It&#x27;s also highly efficient when it comes to data aggregation. For example, counter values are aggregated as they are received. Trends are aggregated into the specified percentiles using the Count-min sketch<sup id="fnref-21"><a href="#fn-21" class="footnote-ref">21</a></sup>, a probabilistic data structure that is much faster than sorting timer data points and selecting the needed percentile. Probabilistic data structures like this allow us to &quot;calculate a good approximation of percentiles at minimal CPU and memory cost&quot; (Kleppman)<sup id="fnref-22"><a href="#fn-22" class="footnote-ref">22</a></sup>.</p><p>Another benefit to Statsite is that it supports multiple &quot;sinks&quot;, or outputs. This makes it flexible in terms of database integration, due to the fact any executable or script can be used as a sink. Overall, using Statsite allows Edamame to significantly minimize the amount of database writes per second. For example, if the load test tracks 20 metrics, the result is 20 writes per five-second flush interval.</p><div class="text--center"><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/logo-light-green-63d3612d3b6478f963f4f702cf93876b.png" alt="Example banner" width="400" class="img_ev3q"><p>üñºÔ∏èZoomed in image of the actual data pipeline portion</p></div><p>While k6 has an output extension that enabled us to output data using StatsD, it had some issues. Namely, gauge metrics from separate load generator pods were overwriting each other (rather than being summed), so we were not receiving accurate test data. Edamame fixes this problem by providing a custom output extension that allows for gauges from separate load generators to be aggregated accurately. We wrote this output extension is written in Go to integrate easily with the k6 custom binary.</p><p>Another hurdle was the fact that Statsite does not provide an out-of-the-box extension that sends metrics to Postgres (our chosen DB, see below). To facilitate this, Edamame includes a custom extension to Statsite written in Node. This converts data to SQL and makes the necessary writes to store the data. The writes are performed on a 5-second flush interval, which we found to provide the best balance of smoothing noise and providing near real-time data analysis.</p><p>Finally, as the functionality of Statsite relies on aggregating data within a single location, it can represent a single point of failure for the system. By deploying Statsite on EKS, Edamame leverages Kubernetes&#x27; self-healing properties to mitigate this issue. If Statsite goes down, the Kubernetes control plane replaces it right away. When testing this eventuality, Edamame lost only a single interval of data, since Statsite was running before the next flush interval occurred. While some small amount of data might be lost, after testing it became clear that this is minimized to an acceptable range of statistical anomaly.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="ii-storing-data-in-postgresql">ii. Storing data in PostgreSQL<a href="#ii-storing-data-in-postgresql" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to ii. Storing data in PostgreSQL" title="Direct link to ii. Storing data in PostgreSQL">‚Äã</a></h4><p>Edamame persists data using a PostgreSQL database. Since the data aggregation pipeline was able to minimize the number of writes per second so significantly, there was no real reason to have a more performant database. Moreover, PostgreSQL integrates well with Grafana, and due to the utilization of a well-known query language like SQL, it makes it easy for the user to set up any custom dashboard or queries necessary to visualize data.</p><p>Since the rest of Edamame&#x27;s architecture is deployed to EKS, it made sense to take advantage of Kubernetes internal Service components and deploy PostgreSQL to the cluster as well. This makes it simple for all components to communicate with each other (they are within the same VPS, and Kubernetes provides persistent IPs for each). This also means the user does not have to pay for a managed database solution, which can be costly. The drawback with this approach is that Kubernetes pods are ephemeral; containers do not persist data across their lifecycle without some additional components to facilitate this.</p><div class="text--center"><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/7-b-ii-database-9b3f03ba1709e557bfdac6d395ecd193.png" alt="Example banner" width="800" class="img_ev3q"><p>üñºÔ∏èZoomed in image of the DB with connection to EBS volume.</p></div><p>Edamame uses AWS Elastic Block Store (EBS) to mount Persistent Volumes with a PostgreSQL instance inside the EKS cluster. The EBS volume is a separate entity outside the EKS cluster, so data stored there is not ephemeral or tied to pod life cycles. The PostgreSQL instance is deployed as a StatefulSet and uses a Persistent Volume Claim to requisition an EBS Volume when it is applied to the cluster. The identity of this volume is persisted across pod lifecycles to ensure that if the pod ever goes down, its replacement can connect to the same Persistent Volume, and no data is lost.</p><p>There are a couple of benefits to this approach. EBS storage costs are minimal when compared with managed database solutions. Moreover, EBS integrates well with EKS, where the rest of the application components are deployed and facilitates fluid communication between services.</p><p>That being said, there are some small trade-offs involved. It adds a bit of complexity to the cluster initialization, as Edamame now adds some pre-configured roles and functionality in the form of the Amazon EBS CSI driver. Furthermore, data is not persisted beyond the cluster lifecycle.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="iii-visualizing-results-in-near-real-time">iii.

This is deployed into the EKS cluster, which allows it to easily connect to other components of the architecture. Grafana is configured to ensure it starts up with a default connection to the PostgreSQL database. The user can access Grafana via secure port forwarding, to ensure privacy and keep potentially sensitive performance data safe.</p><p>Grafana&#x27;s main benefit is the ability to pre-configure custom dashboards. Edamame provides a default dashboard specifically developed for showing WebSocket metrics in conjunction with HTTP. Both the dashboard and its metadata are defined using a Kubernetes ConfigMap. A JSON file is then used to configure the dashboard to our specific use case, for example, by declaring how to display Edamame&#x27;s WebSocket-specific metrics.</p><p>Since Grafana dashboards are defined using SQL queries, the user can easily customize the default dashboard or create new dashboards of their own. To make sure these dashboard configuration values persist, Grafana is also assigned an EBS volume. Since Edamame does not have any constraints on data storage duration, users can view data visualizations for previously run tests, and notice any larger patterns that may occur. This gives deep insight into how target systems are responding to load.</p><div class="text--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76174119/228081027-62238425-b004-482c-b3c7-a11c97411b50.png" alt="Example banner" width="700" class="img_ev3q"></div><div class="text--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76174119/228081016-e669dc4d-d1ce-4483-8924-b72ab8c3d1cb.png" alt="Example banner" width="700" class="img_ev3q"></div><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="8-future-plans">8.

It supports tests of up to 200k virtual users, sufficiently tests complex systems with multiple protocols, and uses a performant data pipeline to aggregate and visualize data in near real-time. That being said, there are several improvements and additional features that could be added in the future.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="a-improving-scalability">a. Improving scalability<a href="#a-improving-scalability" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to a. Improving scalability" title="Direct link to a. Improving scalability">‚Äã</a></h3><p>Edamame&#x27;s data pipeline relies on a single instance of a Statsite server to accurately aggregate test metrics into percentiles. The ability to horizontally scale this component is limited by the complications that aggregating percentiles brings. Currently, our stream processing relies on a probabilistic data structure that cannot be re-aggregated without losing data integrity. This means that data must be collected in a single location and we cannot currently scale beyond its maximum ingestion rate of 2 million data points per second, or approximately 200k virtual users. This is the main limiting factor when it comes to how many virtual users Edamame can support.</p><p>To simulate more than 200k virtual users using Edamame without changing its current architecture, we can further customize the k6 StatsD output extension. Currently, it does not consolidate metrics like counters, which can be easily aggregated without data loss. Summing these data points into a single piece of data would decrease the amount of data being output per virtual user. This increases the amount of simulated load Edamame can generate before reaching Statsite&#x27;s maximum ingestion rate.</p><p>Alternatively, we can make the data pipeline more horizontally scalable. This would involve re-working the architecture, by switching to an approach where data is aggregated at each load generator. Using t-digest<sup id="fnref-23"><a href="#fn-23" class="footnote-ref">23</a></sup> enables us to aggregate percentiles in more than one location. The ability to accurately re-aggregate would immediately cut down on the amount of data being sent through the stream processor, allowing Edamame to scale to even higher numbers of virtual users.</p><p>That being said, aggregating data at each load generator involves sharing compute resources between test runners and data aggregation processes running on the same node. Moreover, there is no current support for t-digest in the k6 ecosystem, nor is there an available t-digest aggregation server, so this approach would involve developing several custom components from scratch.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="b-node-observability">b. Node observability<a href="#b-node-observability" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to b. Node observability" title="Direct link to b. Node observability">‚Äã</a></h3><p>One consideration when adding the ability for users to set a custom number of virtual users per load generator pod is how the user understands whether or not they are overloading the pod. To give insight into this question, Edamame can increase the observability of load test performance. Currently, visibility into the health of load generator nodes can be ascertained by installing a Kubernetes Dashboard<sup id="fnref-24"><a href="#fn-24" class="footnote-ref">24</a></sup>.</p><p>Rather than relying on additional third-party resources, in the future Edamame should provide metrics like CPU consumption, RAM consumption, and bandwidth for load generator nodes. This would allow the user to tailor how load generating infrastructure is set up in a way that&#x27;s more specific to the tests they are running.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="c-data-import-and-export">c.

Data import and export">‚Äã</a></h3><p>Currently, all AWS resources are deleted with the command <code>edamame teardown</code>, including EBS volumes. This means that data is <em>not</em> persisted beyond the lifecycle of the EKS cluster that supports Edamame&#x27;s architecture. We&#x27;d like to give users a way to export data when removing AWS resources, to decrease vendor lock-in.</p><p>As Edamame contains a separate backend API for the database in the form of an Express app, components are already in place to provide this service. To perform the export, one approach would be to create an SQL file representing all the data in the database, which could be downloaded to the user&#x27;s local system. This file could then be used to load the data into another database of the user&#x27;s choosing.</p><p>This approach would also enable Edamame to check for the presence of such a file during the initialization process, and use it to populate the database with the previous cluster&#x27;s data. This would ensure that data is persisted across cluster lifecycles, should the user ever need to take down their EKS infrastructure for any reason.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="9-resources">9.
